        <p>In less than a year after Bangladesh's victory in its War of Independence, the then Prime Minister, 
            Sheikh Mujibur Rahman presented the nation with a Constitution which was secular in character and egalitarian in nature guaranteeing full fundamental rights to all citizens irrespective of religion, caste, creed, class and sex. In 1991, all the political parties in the opposition opted for a parliamentary system of governance in place of then existing presidential system. In 1996 the provision of holding general elections in the country under a non-party neutral caretaker government was incorporated in the Constitution. This was designed to safeguard the franchise of the people. The Constitution of Bangladesh provides for three organs - the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary - for ensuring accountability, transparency and checks and balances of the government. All the three organs function harmoniously.</p>

        <p>During the 14th century, the Muslim invasions established the Sultanate of Bengal. The Sultanate declared Bengali as the official court language of the region. And it soon became the vernacular language of Bengal. However, this version of the Bengali language, known as Middle Bengali, was still very different from the modern one. In the 16th century, the Mughals took over Bengal. The rich Persian language they brought with them began to influence the language. What we call Modern Bengali took shape from the dialect spoken in the Nadia region of Bengal around the time of the Battle of Plassey in 1757. However, the language was split into formal and casual varieties known as “shuddho bhasha” and “cholito bhasha”. It mainly contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, but also loanwords from other languages Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

There would be both a civil war and a revolution by 1700. Land was also far scarcer than in America, and the distance from Britain meant the colonists experienced the benefits of local control and self-government. Thus, moving to the British colonies in America offered colonists a variety of benefits, especially y. As such, many colonists were willing to make the journey, even though doing so often required selling oneself into temporary servitude to afford transportation across the ocean.The arrival in Jamestown, Virginia of a ship carrying African slaves initially captured by a coalition of Portuguese and local Africans from Angola marked the beginning of African slavery in the mainland North American English colonies in 1619.</p>
